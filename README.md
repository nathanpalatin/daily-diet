# ðŸ¥— Daily Diet

> A system to record a user's meals and track their eating journey.

## Getting Started

To start the application on a specific port (3333), use:

```bash
bun dev
```

The application uses environment variables to define the database and port, so create a `.env` file and set the environment variables.

```env
PORT=3333
DATABASE_URL=./db.sqlite
```

End-to-end tests also use environment variables, so create a `.env.test` file and set the environment variables.

```env
DATABASE_URL=./db-test.sqlite
```

Here we define only a new variable for the test database to be separated, so to run the tests, use (we only use end-to-end tests in this project):

```bash
bun run test
```
